# Yijie Chen ‚Äì Dissertation

This repository contains the MSc Robotics dissertation project **‚ÄúA legged robot for low-cost and rapid fabrication towards swarm robots‚Äù**.  
The project explores the design and testing of a bioinspired legged robot using **Variable Amplitude Mechanism (VAM)**, rapid fabrication (laser cutting, LEGO-based joints, and flexure hinges), and experimental validation.
