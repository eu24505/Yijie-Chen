# Yijie Chen ‚Äì Dissertation

This repository contains the MSc Robotics dissertation project **‚ÄúA legged robot for low-cost and rapid fabrication towards swarm robots‚Äù**.  
The project explores the design and testing of a bioinspired legged robot using **Variable Amplitude Mechanism (VAM)**, rapid fabrication (laser cutting, LEGO-based joints, and flexure hinges), and experimental validation.

## üîß Project Highlights

- **Two CAD Versions**: Prototype (3D-printed parts + screws) vs. Improved design (laser-cut + LEGO + flexure hinges).  
- **Low-Cost Fabrication**: Unit cost of ~¬£33.72, fabrication time reduced from 109 minutes (prototype) to 27 minutes (improved).  
- **Experimental Validation**:  
  - Voltage scaling (12‚Äì24 V)  
  - Terrain adaptability (desk, fabric, grass, pavement)  
- **Compact Actuation**: VAM-based locomotion using only **two motors** (DC motor + servo).

## üìä Results Summary

- **Optimal acrylic thickness**: 1.0‚Äì1.2 mm (balance between stress safety and motor torque).  
- **Fabrication cost**: ¬£33.72 per unit.  
- **Locomotion performance**: Stable alternating tripod gait across multiple terrains.
